Why are we communicating this way?   
lol it’s a bit weird to see the link.
I sometimes thought it’s some link to instagram and did not 
look at it right away.

We are going to communicate this way since it is fun and easy for
me to do. I am the only one with access to this page. Plus I can
always add add photos to the link so you will always know where the link is coming from.
