## Why I am starting a business in 2022?

I realized that when are interested in changing the world that you have to start a business. A business is more like created your own metaverse. Where you work with a team who also 
believe in all of your ideas and is willing to construct a better version of themselves for the future of our society.


## What is my mission for my business?

The internet has an insurmountable amount of opportunity that can alter our ways of life for the better. Right now people are trying to alter our lives just for profit and it is causing a greater displacement of children and our future.

Video games, social media, video streaming networks get a bad reputation for being huge distractions but this is because they are programmed to do just that. What if we were able to
reprogrammed them to work to improve productivity and creativity. My company wants to create Creative innovative solutions in the realms of the following

- Serious Games
