## I made a big boo-boo and it is fixed now.

It was about 2 weeks since my last blog post on here. Mainly 
it was because I ran into a build issue with 11ty and I was not able fix it right away. The problem was from a change I made in one of my posts. 

## You can not add comments to your markdown pages.

Markdown is a type of file that allows you to create a page
similar to a HTML page but the way the page is read by your 
build process is different. The error did not show its face 
immediately. Instead I had to read some of the cryptic error
codes that didn't help me figure out


```
> Having trouble rendering njk (and markdown) template ./posts/2021-09-09.md
`TemplateContentRenderError` was thrown
> (./posts/2021-09-09.md) [Line 8, Column 9]
  unknown block tag: image

```
This was the error message that was shown when i ran the command ` eleventy --serve `. It builds the blog pages for the web and then the serves them from the `_site` folder.


This error message may not mean much to you but it is a specifc error in the pages I tried to run with the template for the posts.

Despite not understanding what the error messages actually was I was able to solve the isse but going back and looking at the logs and the changes I made in my git repository.

If you visit the [Github Repo](https://github.com/lrnecgcysiam/fantastic-train)site I have a public copy of the repository available to the world. If you visit that url under the commits you will see.

## Why I still think this is the best way to blog online.

This setup is free if you don't buy a domain. All your content is yours. meaning that this is the single point that your content lives. If you want to change something, you can with your computer and a internet connection.

When you make a mistake you can fix it yourself rather quickly. Your site will not go down like how facebook did yesterday. I talk about this more in a previous blog message.

I plan to write small chunks that will lead to something larger in the future.
