This week fell a bit short due to the conversion day on Tuesday and I have to work on completing homeworks and readings.
I was able to obtain some help on a lot of the work for this week due to the new study group.  

I have created a dropbox to share the future files and I hope will be creating a youtube channel to help everyone 
keep track with what I am working and help explain topics using visual tools

**This Link will work soon**

### Masks are ok!

YOu can wear a mask but you must use the name you use in the class so I can take attendance each time we meet.
