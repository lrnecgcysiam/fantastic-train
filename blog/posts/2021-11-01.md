## November is already here!

October has already come and gone. In New York City the general election will be held tomorrow November 2nd.

### How to vote in this year's general election.

 In order to vote in the citywide General Elections, you must be registered to vote in New York State. There are three ways for New Yorkers to vote. You can either request an absentee ballot in person from your Local BOE office by November 1st to vote by mail, vote in person during early voting (October 23-31), or vote in person on Election Day (November 2). Do you plan to vote early, in-person on Election Day, or by mail?


The New York General Election is tomorrow, 11/2! Get ready to vote.
