### Protecting your mental Projection of your digital self.

Depending on how well you knowledge of pop culture is you will get that reference. When I was starting college I was very interesting in getting into computing. I did not know where I wanted to be in it but I wanted to be doing something that was interesting. 

Years later I realize that if I would like to do that I would need to work on it by myself first and stop waiting for others to help me.

I started normal learning cause I wanted to express that the type of learning I am trying to do is not requiring anything other then the tools you already have. 

In the future I plan to create more courses surrounded about doing the following:

- Website building
- program script creation
- Raspberry Pi exploration
- Creating an Online Book.
- Improving your skills in using your computer in a whole new way.

My courses I will try to create a easy to follow and emulate without having to know anymore than you already do.
