# Why I will obtain a Master's of Arts Degree in Computer Science

Computer science is the study of algorithms computational algorithms , computational machines and computation itself according to wikipedia. It span a broad area of disciplines that I have interest in. I started taking computer science because I have always been fascinated by computers I have always been drawn to it. Before it was cool to be a software engineer. I started with the design aspect of it. Learning how to create websites on the internet. This graduate study is important because I would like to formally understand and believe that I have enough competency on the topic that I can begin working on teaching others.


# Fall Semester 2021 Classes

###  Database systems

Database Systems is a graduate level course designed to help give people a introductory level course to database systems. Database systems such as relational databases, database design and real-world database management. SQL is a database language used to communcate with your database. SQL stands for Structured Query Langauge. The language is easy to learn but takes a while to master. I have enough experience to work with a database on a professional level. I plan to specialized in database management in hopes to deepen my knowledge in database design and management.


### Artificial Intelligence I

The study of how to have animal intelligence can be implemented into machines. Machines are able to compute logical concepts much faster then humans. Machines compute processes that is around the speed of light so this really is fast. With Artificial Intelligence or A.I. for short we can figure out how to get machines to carry out actions that a human can do but the machine can do better. Better in the terms as faster, with out getting fatigue and with less mistakes.

The class is about introducing the idea of a machine as an "Agent" that is able to perform actions that are for a part of the larger collective. If you are familiar with the movie trilogy [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix) where men with dark shades and dark suits were running around defending the system known as the Matrix.
They were never working on there own but for the good of the system.

In this course we are learning about the algorithms, theory and practical using python as the programming language to convert the algorithms into programs. I like the class and I am realy excited to learn more about this interdisciplinary field of computer science.

### Managment in Information Systems

This course is about applying, acquiring and designing information systems. The person who would benefit from this would be a person who needs to work within information technology at a corporate setting. The course uses case studies and project based understanding of how manage information technology within an organization. 

I am taking the course because of the opportunity to obtain the requrements I need for graduation. The course is heavily relies on theory versus practical. It is a great course to take with the other courses that requirement lots of project based work.


### Programming Languages and Compilers Design

This course is based around the study of compiler design and the programming languages that are used to within a compiler. A compiler is a program component within the higher level programming language such as Java or C++ . The convenience of writing code in a way that a human can understand is called higher level language. 

In reality the computer is not able to understand that in without a compiler that breaks down words and syntactical structure that is required of the programming language into machine code that are low level instruction of moving bits across an instruction set. 

So the Compiler is pretty much a translator that helps with getting the correct grammar, syntax and language to and from the user.

## Stay tuned...

I think I will start a series of my progress each week or so and maybe share my work with everyone to learn about.
