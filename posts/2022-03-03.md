### Updates to the site

So you might notice I been playing around with the sites style sheet. The css is written CSS3 and uses prismjs for syntax highlighting I was trying to make the syntax highlight section look and feel the same as the writing the web page in my text editor.

## Prism JS

Prism is a lightweight, extensible syntax highlighter, built with modern web standards in mind. Itâ€™s used in millions of websites, including some of those you visit daily.

This is the text that lives on the landing page of [prismjs.com](https://prismjs.com/) I wanted to start leaving snippets of code on this page and I wanted it to look nice ( to me at least lol) 

## Eleventy Starter 

This site is based on the eleventy starter site and it is a great please to get started if you wish to learn how to use eleventy for your own website. The github repo for this page is found at github  @[fantastic-train](https://github.com/lrnecgcysiam/fantastic-train)

I am using this page to eventually become the main site for all the latest news across [lrnecgysiam.com](https://lrnecgysiam.com) I will soon add youtube links to videos links to other pages and more.
