## Brothers.....,
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/3RVFCxt6/Tik-Tok-video-7161488662159510827-7161488662159510827-mp4.gif">

<p>
This is a start in the direction of making money online. 
As you might know that porn is a billion dollar industry.
Over a third of the internet downloads are porngraphic. 
13,000 porn movies are made each year that is about 13 billion dollars in Profit. 
A male porn star can make $500 for straight
scenes and $1500 for gay scenes. 
</p>

<p>
I am trying to find a niche within this space and build a brand with in it.
I do not have to start with me doing my own porn but I will if I had too. (LOL)
I am just brand building at the moment. Japan has a very successful porn industry
and I am starting here for my research.
</p>

### How you can help.
<p>
In Japan many artist make money by selling there artwork to fans through online and offline channels.
One popular online channel is COMIKET it is an event that happens 2x a year where amateur and professional
artist come together with the public and sell items face to face. Many of the goods sold are sold here first
before they go to the mass markets. So purchasing things here is like buying and iphone the day it comes out and
selling it online. I plan to do this but I will still need help getting to Tokyo and staying in a place that 
will be safe enough to store all the goods I am purchasing for everyone. I am doing this alone but this is not my first time 
I am doing this. I have been to this event several times in the past.

The american dollar is strong at the moment right now (1 USD === 133 YEN)
So a one way ticket from my current location is about 100 USD.
I plan to stay in TOKYO 12/29 - 1/1 (2-3 nights)

I am not sure if you help me entirely but I think that there is enough
of us that we can think of something. I feel good about this deal. 
If you would like you can even purchase some games to help out 
my friends family and hopefully shed some light on this situation.
